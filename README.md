# Fashion MNIST Classification with ANN

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for classifying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The project involves exploring different hyperparameters and evaluating the model's performance.

## Overview

Fashion MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
